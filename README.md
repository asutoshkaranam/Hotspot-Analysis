# Hotspot-Analysis
The project involves implementing spatial hot spot analysis using Apache Spark. Tasks include hot zone analysis, calculating rectangle hotness based on point density, and hot cell analysis, identifying significant spatial hot spots in NYC taxi trip data. Submissions require coding, documentation, and jar packaging.

The project focuses on spatial hot spot analysis utilizing Apache Spark, with two main tasks: hot zone analysis and hot cell analysis. 

For hot zone analysis, the goal is to determine the "hotness" of rectangles by performing a range join operation between a set of rectangles and a point dataset. Each rectangle's hotness is determined by the number of points it contains, indicating higher density areas. Participants are required to set up a Hadoop and Apache Spark environment, complete the analysis programming assignment, and submit their code as a .jar file along with a project report detailing their work.

In hot cell analysis, the objective is to identify statistically significant spatial hot spots using the Getis-Ord statistic applied to NYC taxi trip datasets. The input consists of monthly taxi trip data from 2009 to 2012, focusing solely on pick-up locations. Participants are provided with coding templates but must implement a Spark program to calculate the Getis-Ord statistic, considering the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data. Output should include the coordinates of the top 50 hottest cells sorted by their G score, with the requirement to not output the G score itself.

The project necessitates understanding spatial statistics, familiarity with Apache Spark programming, and proficiency in handling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets. Participants must adhere to specific input parameters, coding template specifications, and submission guidelines, ensuring their code can compile and package correctly. Debugging in Scala IDEs like IntelliJ Idea is recommended, with the final submission requiring packaging the code into a .jar file for Spark execution. Through this project, participants gain practical experience in spatial analysis techniques and big data processing using distributed computing frameworks like Spark.
